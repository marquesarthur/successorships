\section{Proposed Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

Our goal is to build a framework to facilitate the development of offline client-server Web applications that robustly recover from server faults. 
We posit that the following features are prerequisites to achieving this:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Any client, but exactly one client, has the ability to automatically assume the responsibilities of the server if the server goes down;
    \item All clients in the network have the capability to automatically update their connections to the new server in the event that the server migrates from one node to another;
    \item Communication in the network is not traffic intensive, i.e. nodes neither produce bursts of requests in a small period of time nor have payloads higher than some threshold $\tau$ that might generate bottlenecks in the network;
    
\end{enumerate}

The model we propose for achieving this is one in which clients connecting to the server automatically acquire distributed state including the following elements:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Constant: A UUID for the initial host node (the first to serve the application);
    \item The current state of the server;
	\item A ``successorship'' list: a list of (potentially not all of the) nodes in the local network, in order of ``who is next'' to assume server responsibilities, in the event that the server goes down;
    \item Constant: The actual server code to execute, in the event that one of the clients needs to begin acting as the server.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the elements marked ``(Constant)'' are permanently fixed (for the lifetime of the application) when the initial server node first runs the application server.

We propose to develop a Javascript library that implements the functionality listed above, providing a clean interface to enable developers to seamlessly integrate fault-tolerance into their offline client-server Web applications, without having to worry about the details of how such fault-tolerance is achieved.
